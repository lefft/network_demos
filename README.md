## network analysis demos 


#### `TODO` for setting up network hijack workflow 

- go thru all old code 
- toss unneeded old code 
- clean up + document old code that will be kept 
- write clean R MWE with `igraph::` and `networkD3::` 
- write corresponding python MWE (but w `networkx`) 
- find py library for generating d3 force plot code from edge list (if exists)
- write funcs to take in tweet json and extract df suitable for network graphs 
- write a very high level api for making force plots + distribute to team (R is higher priority than py)
