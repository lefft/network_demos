## network analysis demos 

#### `TODO` prepping network hijack project workflow 

- [x] go thru all old code 
- [x] toss unneeded old code 
- [ ] clean up + document old code that will be kept 
- [x] write clean(ish) R MWE with `igraph::` and `networkD3::` 
- [x] write corresponding python MWE (but w `networkx`) 
- [ ] utils for reading edgelists from text files 
- [ ] update demos with real edgelist from file 
- [ ] find py library for generating `d3js` force plot code from edge list (if doesn't exist, should write/release it!)
- [ ] write funcs to take in tweet json and extract df suitable for network graphs 
- [ ] write a very high level api for making force plots + distribute to team (R is higher priority than py)
